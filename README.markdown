    < skampler> what is paws exactly? :)
    < skampler> is paws a javascript re-implementation in javascript?
    <+elliottcable> skampler: uh, programming language, fully async (the
                    first, I believe), heavily bootstrapped in libspace,
                    super-simple syntax, super-simple central concepts,
                    reference impl is in JavaScript and intended to run
                    equally well in the browser and on the serverside, uhhhhh…
    <+elliottcable> did I miss anything, guys?
    <@alexgordon> it's crazy
    < skampler> okay!
    <+elliottcable> skampler: nope, it’s an *entirely* new language. Bits were
                    inspired by JavaScript (as well as Io, Ruby, Python, and
                    Objective-C)… and I’m told the end product is semantically
                    similar to Lisp in some ways… but no, it’s not an
                    implementation of any existing language
    <+inimino> man, that was surprisingly coherent
    <+inimino> you should put that up somewhere and call it the home page

I’m dumb. These people are smart. ’nuff said.

1. Paws wouldn’t’ve been possible at all without:
   - Alex Gordon <http://fileability.net>
   - Michaeljohn Clement <http://www.google.com/search?q=inimino>
   
   These two have way, way more low‐level interpreter‐fu than myself, and
   helped me stop myself when I made stupid decisions. They also arbitrated my
   stupid‐ass arguments with…

2. The clustersentience that is Devyn and his circle of language‐obsessee
   friends:
   - Devyn Cairns
   - Micah Johnston
   - Timothy McDowell

3. Finally, some tasty scandies who kept me company:
   - Mikael Høilund <http://hoilund.org>
   - Magnus Holm <http://judofyr.net>
   - Harry Vangberg <http://harry.vangberg.name>

4. There’s a dude named ‘Rusky’ in the IRC channel, but nobody has a fucking
   clue who he is. So, him too.
