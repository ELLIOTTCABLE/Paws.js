I’m dumb. These people are smart. ’nuff said.

1. Paws wouldn’t’ve been possible at all without:
   - Alex Gordon <http://fileability.net>
   - Michaeljohn Clement <http://www.google.com/search?q=inimino>
   
   These two have way, way more low‐level interpreter‐fu than myself, and
   helped me stop myself when I made stupid decisions. They also arbitrated my
   stupid‐ass arguments with…

2. The clustersentience that is Devyn and his circle of language‐obsessee
   friends:
   - Devyn Cairns
   - Micah Johnston
   - Timothy McDowell

3. Finally, some tasty scandies who kept me company:
   - Mikael Høilund <http://hoilund.org>
   - Magnus Holm <http://judofyr.net>
   - Harry Vangberg <http://harry.vangberg.name>

4. There’s a dude named ‘Rusky’ in the IRC channel, but nobody has a fucking
   clue who he is. So, him too.
